NOTES
--------------

2a. Rendering a collection, modules
    Always use functional programming operaters with arrays (find, filter, map)

    Generate React elements from array objects
        Key attribute - used to determine how to update the view generated 
        by a component when the component is re-rendered
            Each child in an array or any iterator should have a unique 
            `key` prop

            Errors: notes.map(note => <li>{note.content}</li>)

            Works: notes.map(note => <li key={note.id}>{note.content}</li>)

        Using Array Index as Key - Not recommended!
            Will technically work in most cases, but can lead to issues

    Components commonly defined in src/components/
        Referenced from other components (or App.jsx) like so:
            import Note from './components/Note'

            location is always given in relation to the importing file

2b. Forms
    Basic form syntax:
        <form onSubmit={eventHandler}>
            <input type='text' />
            <button type="submit">Save</button>
        </form> 

        basic event handler:
            const eventHandler = (event) => {
                event.preventDefault()
                console.log('button clicked', event.target)
            }
    
    Controlled Components - method for extracting form inputs
        Add a new piece of state and set it to the `value` attribute of 
        the input element along with an event handler assigned to the 
        `onChange` attribute 

        Form definition:
            <input value={newValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
        
        Event Handler:
            const handleInputChange = (event) => {
                console.log(event.target.value)
                setNewValue(event.target.value)
            }

            event.preventDefault() is not needed here because there is no 
            default action for an input change
