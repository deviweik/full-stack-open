NOTES
--------------

2a. Rendering a collection, modules
    Always use functional programming operaters with arrays (find, filter, map)

    Generate React elements from array objects
        Key attribute - used to determine how to update the view generated 
        by a component when the component is re-rendered
            Each child in an array or any iterator should have a unique 
            `key` prop

            Errors: notes.map(note => <li>{note.content}</li>)

            Works: notes.map(note => <li key={note.id}>{note.content}</li>)

        Using Array Index as Key - Not recommended!
            Will technically work in most cases, but can lead to issues

    Components commonly defined in src/components/
        Referenced from other components (or App.jsx) like so:
            import Note from './components/Note'

            location is always given in relation to the importing file

Part 1 Lessons Learned:
    - New project
    - Create component and pass props
    - Shared state
    - Event handlers
    - Complex state + spread syntax 
    - Conditional rendering
